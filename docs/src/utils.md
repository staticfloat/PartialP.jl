# Utilities

PartialP provides a set of helpful utilities. These are all "user-level" tools â€“
in other words you could have written them easily yourself, but they live in
PartialP for convenience.

```@docs
PartialP.@showgrad
PartialP.hook
PartialP.dropgrad
PartialP.hessian
PartialP.Buffer
PartialP.forwarddiff
```
